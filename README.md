Cocktail Explorer App : GetYourCockTail
---
## Welcome to Cocktail Explorer, an Android app designed to help you discover and explore a variety of cocktails based on your preferences. This app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern, ensuring a clean and modular architecture.

## Features
Search Cocktails: Enter your preferred cocktail ingredient (e.g., "Vodka," "Rum," "Margarita") to get a grid of matching cocktails.
Detailed View: Tap on any cocktail to view detailed information, including full instructions, ingredients, thumbnail, measure, and category.
Static UI Elements: Some UI elements, such as "Let's eat quality food," "Near restaurant," and a row below it, are static and hardcoded for a consistent user experience.
